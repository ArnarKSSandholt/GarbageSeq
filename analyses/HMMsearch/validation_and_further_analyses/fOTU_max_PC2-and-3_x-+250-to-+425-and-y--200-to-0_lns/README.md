# Directory contents

This directory contains one file per each soft links to putatively predominantly viral fOTU data files. This direktory makes it easier to handle all the viral files using globbing in bash. The cluster from which the fOTU files are from is `fOTU_max_PC2-and-3_x-+250-to-+425-and-y--200-to-0`.
