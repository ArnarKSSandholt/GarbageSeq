# Directory contents

This directory contains HMM analyses using HMMs from eggNOG v. 5.0.0.

The files/folders are:

- `virus_taxids.csv` 
    
    This contains the taxids of 28 different taxonomic levels of viruses listed in: http://eggnog5.embl.de/app/home#/app/downloads
    They were simply obtained by copying from that URL on 2019-11-19 and storing only the viral taxonomic level and its NCBI taxid.
